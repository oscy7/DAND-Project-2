## Second DAND Project - Investigating Dataset: Brazil Hospital Appointment

In this project, I analyzed a CSV of medical appointments from Brazilian hospitals and focused on whether patients showed up or not. I investigated what factors were important to see if we can predict if a patient will show up to an appointment.
